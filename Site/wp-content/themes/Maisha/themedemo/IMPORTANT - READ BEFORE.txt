Theme Demo Setup:

Install the theme installation zip "maishawp.zip" by going to Appearance->Themes->Add New->Upload Theme

To import demo content from the live preview, you first need to install the plugins we used with the theme demo:

1. BuddyPress: https://buddypress.org/">https://buddypress.org/ - run your own social network
2. bbPress: https://bbpress.org/ - forums made the WordPress way
3. Contact Form 7: https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/ - contact form
4. Give: https://wordpress.org/plugins/give/ - empower your cause: start accepting donations on WordPress with Give.
5. The Events Calendar: https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/ - plugin that lets you easily share your events.
6. Soliloquy Slider plugin can be found inside the <strong>plugins</strong> folder within the main folder you downloaded
7. WooCommerce: http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/ - create your own shop
8. Widget Visibility: https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-visibility/

After you installed and activated plugins above you can start importing the demo content.

1. Content Demo: maishademo.wordpress.2015-05-28.xml - to import demo content navigate to the Tools - Import and import this file

2. Widget Settings: www.anariel.com-maishademo-widgets.wie - to import widget content please install: https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/ activate the plugin and navigate to the Tools - Widget Settings Import and import this file. Make sure to remove the default widgets from widget areas before importing.

3. Customizer Settings: maishawp-export.dat - to import Customizer settings please install: https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/ and activate it. Navigate to the Customizer - Export/Import and import this file.

After you imported content there are a couple of settings that are needed to be done manually:

1. In Settings->Reading select "A static page" and from drop downs choose for the front page "Front Page" and for posts page "Blog"
2. In WooCommerce->Settings->Products->Display select "Shop" to be your "Shop Page"
3. In Events Calendar->Settings->Display select "Events Page" from the "Events Template" drop down
4. In Settings->BuddyPress select all boxes

This is it! You can remove the three plugins used to import content, widgets and customizer.
